Welcome to my personal website!
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Vanderbilt University specializing in high-performance computing (HPC) and reinforcement learning for energy-efficient systems. My research focuses on optimizing the performance and power consumption of HPC systems using AI-driven approaches, including reinforcement learning, for efficient resource management.

I am passionate about advancing AI technologies and their applications in real-time systems, cybersecurity for operational technology (OT) networks, and the development of intelligent infrastructure for future computing systems.

My current work is supported by collaborations with institutions like Argonne National Laboratory and involves developing testbeds for testing cybersecurity agents and AI-based optimization for energy management in computational systems.

On this website, you will find details about my research, publications, talks, and projects. Please feel free to explore and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

Research Interests
======
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Applying reinforcement learning techniques to optimize energy consumption and performance in HPC systems.
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Research on power caps, energy management, and the optimization of resource usage in large-scale computational systems.
* **Cybersecurity**: Developing advanced testbeds for testing cybersecurity agents and mitigation strategies in OT networks.
